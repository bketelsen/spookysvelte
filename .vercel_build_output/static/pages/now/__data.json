If you have your own blog, <a href=\"https://nownownow.com/about\">you should make one</a> too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"parenting-child-number-four\">Parenting Child Number Four</h2>\n<p>Not that I'm not also parenting the rest, but Number Four has <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7097/muenke-syndrome\">Muenke Syndrome</a> and all of our spare time has been swallowed by doctor visits, tests, MRI's, CT Scans, multiple surgeries and -- of course -- an adorable baby boy who is the light of my life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cloud-advocacy\">Cloud Advocacy</h2>\n<p>I really enjoy doing Cloud Advocacy work at Microsoft. I've been able to 'touch' so many different things, technologies, tools... it's wonderful for my wandering ADHD mind. Coming up on 5 years this summer, which is close to the longest I've ever stayed at one job. The record is CIO/COO for <a href=\"https://www.clarityservices.com/\">Clarity Services</a>, where I led a team that built a consumer credit bureau from scratch.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rust-web-technologies\">Rust &amp; Web Technologies</h2>\n<p>I lamented in maybe 2017 that the modern web was beyond my grasp. I doubled down learning Javascript and the Node.js ecosystem, and I'm proud to say I'm fairly capable now with basic web development in Next.Js, Svelte, React and more. I pulled that off! Now I'm doing fun work in Rust with Web Assembly. Another challenge -- Never Stop Learning!</p>\n<h2 id=\"that-florida-life\">That Florida Life</h2>\n<p>I still hate Florida, but nearly everybody I love is here. So I'm still here, I guess. It's too hot, too humid, and some of the people are downright scary. Oh yeah, and practically every animal here is interested in killing you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"encore-api\">Encore API</h2>\n<p>I'm powering my &quot;Personal API&quot; with <a href=\"https://encore.dev\">encore</a>. <em>This has really opened up so many possibilites</em>. I have micro-service style APIs for things like the blog, twitter, my email newsletter, a URL shortener and then some fun composite services that do things like auto-tweet new posts or send email notifications to subscribers of the blog for new articles. I'm just getting started, and I'm expecting that this will evolve rapidly into a really cool hub for all my digital world.</p>\n<p>Last update 1 May 2022</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","comment_id":"62826ff8531f79020b2ba1df","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2022-05-16T11:38:32.000-04:00","updated_at":"2022-05-16T11:39:20.000-04:00","published_at":"2022-05-16T11:39:20.000-04:00","custom_excerpt":"Catch up with me if we haven't talked in a bit.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[],"authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Brian Ketelsen","slug":"brian","profile_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/logo-copy-1.png","cover_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/time-machine-1.jpg","bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":"@bketelsen","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/author/brian/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"Brian Ketelsen","slug":"brian","profile_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/logo-copy-1.png","cover_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/time-machine-1.jpg","bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":"@bketelsen","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/author/brian/"},"primary_tag":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/now/","excerpt":"Catch up with me if we haven't talked in a bit.","reading_time":1,"page":true,"access":true,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"frontmatter":null}}
