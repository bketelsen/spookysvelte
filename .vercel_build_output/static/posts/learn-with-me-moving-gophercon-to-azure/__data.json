My purview is Go, Linux, Containers, and Kubernetes. While brainstorming ways to learn about all that Azure has to offer an idea occured to me: Why not move Gophercon over to Azure as a learning tool. I've decided to do just that and share my learnings along the way.</p>\n<p>This year we used <a href=\"https://gobuffalo.io\">Buffalo</a> and <a href=\"https://ponzu-cms.org\">Ponzu</a> as the main components of the website for Gophercon. Generally it was a huge improvement over our previous <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">hugo</a> workflow, because Ponzu allowed us to get non-technical people contributing content. Hugo is amazing, but requiring <code>git</code> limits the people who can edit the site.</p>\n<p>For 2018 I want to step up my game and build the site using <a href=\"https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs\">GopherJS</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_myitcv\">Paul Jolly</a> has built some really clean React bindings for GopherJS, and I think this is a good opportunity for me to polish up my frontend chops which are sorely lacking.</p>\n<p>Since we don't really need the site to be functional until roughly the end of December (beyond a placeholder page) that gives me an opportunity to get all of this worked out and setup. Here are my goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>100% Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery</li>\n<li>Enable content editors/creators to publish without a <code>git</code> workflow</li>\n<li>Explore as much of the Azure ecosystem as I can during the process</li>\n<li>Favor Go projects where I can, but choose the right tools for the job</li>\n<li>Use CDN for static assets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Last year, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ashleymcnamara\">Ashley McNamara</a> was my partner in crime for the GopherCon website. She's graciously agreed to continue in this role for 2018, so we'll be learning together for some of this.</p>\n<p>I'm excited to learn new things, and share as I go. Thanks for coming along for the ride.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","comment_id":"62890cf6c868ac020bd6858b","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/azure.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-05-21T12:01:58.000-04:00","updated_at":"2022-05-21T12:03:24.000-04:00","published_at":"2017-07-31T00:00:00.000-04:00","custom_excerpt":"While brainstorming ways to learn about all that Azure has to offer an idea occurred to me: Why not move Gophercon over to Azure as a learning tool.
