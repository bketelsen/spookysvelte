The system relies on a single function in my <code>bashrc</code> and a directory full of bash scripts. Let's dive in and see how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"installation-scripts\">Installation Scripts</h3>\n<p>In my dotfiles directory, which is stored at <code>~/dotfiles</code> there's a subdirectory called <code>install</code>. That directory contains a few dozen bash scripts that install the various software components and packages I might use. Some of them are needed on all the computers I use, some of them are used only infrequently for certain projects. Here's an example that installs Go:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ go.sh\n#! /bin/bash\nset -e\nVERSION=1.15\n# Delete existing Go installation\nsudo rm -rf /usr/local/go\n# Install Go in /usr/local\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/local/go &amp;&amp; curl -Ls https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go$VERSION.linux-amd64.tar.gz | sudo tar xvzf - -C /usr/local/go --strip-components=1\n</code></pre>\n<p>The script declares a <code>VERSION</code> variable so I can change the version to be installed when there's a new release of Go. Then it deletes the existing Go installation and replaces it with a freshly downloaded version. Because it deletes the existing install and replaces it, it can be run more than once with no unwanted side-effects. I've attempted to make all my scripts idempotent like this, but some of them just aren't because my bash skills are just mediocre.</p>\n<h3 id=\"installation-function\">Installation Function</h3>\n<p>To use these installation scripts I've created a bash function that searches for scripts in the <code>~/dotfiles/install</code> folder matching the first argument of the function:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">inst() {\n\tif [ -f $HOME/dotfiles/install/$1.sh ] ; then\n\t\techo Installing $1\n\t\t. $HOME/dotfiles/install/$1.sh\n\telse\n\t\techo $1 not found\n\tfi\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>To install Go using this function I would type <code>$&gt; inst go</code>, which would search for a script called <code>~/dotfiles/install/go.sh</code> and execute it if it exists. It's not complicated, and only took a few minutes to write the function, but I'm getting a lot of ROI on the time I spend writing installation scripts. When I spin up a new VM somewhere, I can quickly clone my dotfiles and install just the bits I need for a particular task.</p>\n<h3 id=\"direnv-integration\">Direnv integration</h3>\n<p>I've been playing with <code>direnv</code> integrations to make the installation of required tools or commands automatic when entering a project directory. I haven't found anything yet that doesn't feel too &quot;hacky&quot;, so I haven't finished this part.</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-ideas\">Future Ideas</h2>\n<p>In the future I may extend the script to search for installation scripts with an <code>arch</code> component in the file path, like <code>~/dotfiles/install/linux/go.sh</code> or <code>~/dotfiles/install/macos/go.sh</code>. I don't have a need for this right now because I'm not using my Mac for development work.</p>\n<p>I may also consider making <code>meta</code> scripts that call others. It might be similar to installing a Development metapackage, where the metapackage simply calls the other packages it wants to wrap.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","comment_id":"62890ee8c868ac020bd685b9","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/4pPzKfd6BEg.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2022-05-21T12:10:16.000-04:00","updated_at":"2022-05-21T12:12:01.000-04:00","published_at":"2020-08-14T00:00:00.000-04:00","custom_excerpt":"This bash setup is the latest evolution of my quest to make a new system install as fast as possible.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"62889299a640e2020be86e4a","name":"Linux","slug":"linux","description":"Linux","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/Bit_Linux.png","visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":"#012293","url":"https://brian.dev/tag/linux/"}],"authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Brian Ketelsen","slug":"brian","profile_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/logo-copy-1.png","cover_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/time-machine-1.jpg","bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":"@bketelsen","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/author/brian/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"Brian Ketelsen","slug":"brian","profile_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/logo-copy-1.png","cover_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/time-machine-1.jpg","bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":"@bketelsen","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/author/brian/"},"primary_tag":{"id":"62889299a640e2020be86e4a","name":"Linux","slug":"linux","description":"Linux","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/Bit_Linux.png","visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":"#012293","url":"https://brian.dev/tag/linux/"},"url":"https://brian.dev/bash-helpers-for-quick-installs/","excerpt":"This bash setup is the latest evolution of my quest to make a new system install as fast as possible.","reading_time":2,"access":true,"send_email_when_published":false,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null,"frontmatter":null},{"id":"62889299a640e2020be86e55","uuid":"eeee9cd8-bf6d-4b52-a043-e395aa9610c0","title":"Byobu on WSL","slug":"byobu-on-wsl","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href=\"http://byobu.co/\">Byobu</a> is a frontend for <code>tmux</code> and <code>screen</code> that allows you to save your terminal sessions and reconnect to them easily.

From your shell prompt, type the command <code>byobu-enable</code>. This will enable a wrapper script that wraps your login session with a <code>byobu</code> session. You can disable this with <code>byobu-disable</code>.</p>\n<p>With <code>byobu</code> in &quot;enabled&quot; mode, every time I open a terminal it drops me into either an existing <code>byobu</code> session if one exists, or creates a new one for me. It's a delightful way to resume where I left off without having to worry about whether I started a <code>tmux</code> session.</p>\n<h3 id=\"usage\">Usage</h3>\n<p>In stark contrast to <code>tmux</code> and <code>screen</code>, <code>byobu</code> is pretty easy to use. By default it uses mostly function keys to manage your session. In the background, <code>byobu</code> issues appropriate commands to <code>tmux</code> or <code>screen</code> on your behalf, so you don't have to remember those crazy control sequences.</p>\n<h4 id=\"windows\">Windows</h4>\n<p>Once inside a <code>byobu</code> session, you can create multiple windows inside your terminal session. If you've used a terminal client that supports tabs, this isn't much different. The benefit is that your windows are persisted with your session. So you can exit and resume your session with all your windows intact.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/byobunvim.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1907\" height=\"1281\" srcset=\"https://brian.dev/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/byobunvim.png 600w, https://brian.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/byobunvim.png 1000w, https://brian.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2022/05/byobunvim.png 1600w, https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/byobunvim.png 1907w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>A second Byobu window</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Windows are labeled with a number in the status bar at the bottom of the screen.

Let's start with the obvious ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm a digital packrat</li>\n<li>I'm a single parent of 3 (and therefore busy)</li>\n<li>I can be lazy sometimes</li>\n<li>I have ADHD, and get easily sidetracked from things I intended to do</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When my dad passed away last year, it got even worse. Suddenly I was getting all of his mail, bills, correspondence, too. I didn't want to lose it; but I sure wasn't ready to read it all. So I scanned it and dropped it in the <code>Unfiled</code> folder.</p>\n<p>So now we're here. Where <code>here</code> is a place where I can't find anything I need and my <code>Documents</code> directory is the definition of <code>hot-mess</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-goal\">The Goal</h3>\n<p>I'd like to take that folder of 3000 random unclassified documents and sort them into something more clear. I think sorting them by originating source (Supplier, Vendor, Biller, Organization) is a good first step. Eventually I'd like to sort them by date group too. Probably by Year, then Month.</p>\n<p>For a bonus, I'd love to do a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/projfs/projected-file-system?WT.mc_id=none-twitter-brketels\">projected filesystem</a> sort of thing in Windows and a <a href=\"https://9p.io/wiki/plan9/Installing_a_Plan_9_File_Server/index.html\">Plan9</a> type server on Mac/Linux using FUSE. It'd be really convenient to be able to get at documents from a Filesystem interface by using different facets like keywords, dates, categories, etc. That might fit more cleanly with the way I think, too. But, again, that's a stretch goal, because we'll need all that metadata first.</p>\n<p>If you're old enough to remember <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/07/the-beos-filesystem/\">BeOS Filesystem</a>, it would have solved nearly all of this. Someday we'll get back to the database/filesystem mashup that truly needs to exist.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-solutions\">The Solution(s)</h3>\n<p>First, there isn't really a one-step solution to this. It's going to take some work, and I can likely automate MOST of that. But there will still be a good portion of things I can't sort automatically.</p>\n<h4 id=\"step-one\">Step One</h4>\n<p>As a first step, I wrote a small Go program that calls <a href=\"https://cda.ms/126\">Azure Cognitive Services</a> Vision API to do Optical Character Recognition on all the files that are compatible (PDF and image files). Nearly everything I have is in pdf format, but there are a few TIFF files in there too. This program is in flux right now, so I'm not going to release it as Open Source until it's settled a bit. If I forget - ping me on twitter @bketelsen or email mail@bjk.fyi - and remind me! Related: the code samples in this post are probably garbage, and won't likely match the end result that I publish. I'm sure I'm swallowing errors, and haven't done the slightest bit of refactor/cleanup on this code yet.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WARNING: <em>Don't cut/paste this code yet, please.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I created a domain type appropriately called <code>Document</code> that stores metadata about files on disk:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-go\">type Document struct {\n\tHash         string\n\tPath         string\n\tPreviousPath string\n\tOperation    *CognitiveOperation\n\tResults      *CognitiveReadResponse\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'll discuss the fields as they come up, but <code>Path</code> and <code>PreviousPath</code> should be obvious. Current and previous location on disk, so that I can account for file moves with at least a little bit of history.</p>\n<p>The pricing for the OCR is really attractive - as of September, 2019 it is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>0-1M transactions — $1.50 per 1,000 transactions</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I know that I'll be fine tuning the processes that run, and likely running them repeatedly. I wanted to find a way to store the results from the OCR for each document, but I am also aware that I can't use the document name and path as the canonical key to find the document later, because the goal of this app is to move them and rename them appropriately! So I decided to use a hash of the file contents as a key. <code>SHA256</code> seems to be the right algorithm for file contents, low cost computation, low collision chance. So I created a hash function that calculates the <code>SHA256</code> hash of the document after it is read:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-go\">func (d *Document) GetHash() {\n\n\tf, err := os.Open(d.Path)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\tdefer f.Close()\n\n\th := sha256.New()\n\tif _, err := io.Copy(h, f); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\td.Hash = fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%x&quot;, h.Sum(nil))\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>After getting the results of the OCR operation, I set them in the <code>Document</code> type, then persist the metadata to disk in a hidden directory. Currently that's <code>~/.classifier/</code> but, as with all of this, it might change in the future.</p>\n<p>The file is stored using the <code>SHA256</code> hash of the contents as the file name, and the <code>Document</code> type is serialized to disk using Go's efficient and lightweight <code>encoding/gob</code> format. While I'm debugging and playing with this code, I decided to also persist the data in <code>json</code> format so it's easier to read. Here's the method on <code>Document</code> that saves/serializes to disk:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-go\">func (d *Document) SaveMetadata() error {\n  fmt.Println(d.Hash)\n  //TODO use new XDG config dir location\n  // https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os/#UserConfigDir\n\tfilePath := &quot;/home/bjk/.classifier/&quot; + d.Hash // TODO FILEPATH.JOIN\n\tfmt.Println(filePath)\n\tfile, err := os.OpenFile(filePath, os.O_TRUNC|os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY, 0644)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\tdefer file.Close()\n\tenc := gob.NewEncoder(file)\n\terr = enc.Encode(d)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\tjfilePath := &quot;/home/bjk/.classifier/&quot; + d.Hash + &quot;.json&quot; // TODO FILEPATH.JOIN\n\tfmt.Println(jfilePath)\n\tjfile, err := os.OpenFile(jfilePath, os.O_TRUNC|os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY, 0644)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\tdefer jfile.Close()\n\tjenc := json.NewEncoder(jfile)\n\treturn jenc.Encode(d)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Lots of bad things happening in there, see above caveats about copying/pasting this code. The important part is the encoding in <code>gob</code> format of the contents of the <code>Document</code> metadata, which is then saved to disk using the <code>SHA256</code> hash as the filename. This is a nice future-proof solution, and provides several benefits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is already a file with the same name, it's been processed once.</li>\n<li>If the <code>.Path</code> is different from the document I'm inspecting, I might have an exact duplicate, which is a candidate for (soft) deleting</li>\n<li>It doesn't matter where the files get moved, as long as the <code>SHA256</code> hash matches, I've got the metadata saved already.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a very low-tech metadata database, of sorts. It's definitely not optimized for real-time use, but instead for batch operations.</p>\n<p>Keeping all the metadata in this format means I can write any number of other tools to read and modify the metadata without worrying too much.</p>\n<h3 id=\"step-two\">Step Two</h3>\n<p>At this point, I have a directory full of unprocessed files and a way to process them once and save the results so I don't have to re-process them later. It's time to fire off the processing app. I used <a href=\"https://github.com/spf13/cobra\">cobra</a> to build the command-line utility, so I made the root/naked command do the actual calls to Azure Cognitive Services:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">go build\n./classifier\n</code></pre>\n<p>This iterates over every file in the <code>~/Documents/Unfiled</code> directory, calling Cognitive Services OCR for the file types that are supported. There is no current mechanism to retrieve metadata from other document types (Word documents, text files, etc). That's a future addition.</p>\n<p>After receiving the results, the responses are serialized using the above mentioned <code>gob</code> serialization into <code>~/.classifier/HASH</code></p>\n<h3 id=\"classification\">Classification</h3>\n<p>Based on the results there are some simple <code>bag of words</code> matches that can be done. Some of the documents I have contain very unique text that is indicative of a particular document type. For example, Bank of America always includes my account number and their address in <code>Wilmington</code>. No other document in my corpus has those two distinct things together, so I can write a simple classifier for all Bank of America documents. I decided to use simple TOML for a configuration file here:</p>\n<pre><code>[[entity]]\nname = &quot;Bank of America&quot;\ndirectory = &quot;BOA&quot;\nkeywords = [&quot;Bank of America&quot;,&quot;12345677889&quot;,&quot;Wilmington&quot;]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, I added a sub-command in <code>cobra</code> so I can classify files without re-posting them to Cognitive Services. So I added the <code>classifier process</code> command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">./classifier process\n</code></pre>\n<p>It currently goes through all the files in <code>Unfiled</code> and checks their metadata for matches against the TOML file. This worked perfectly for several of my external correspondents. It took all the documents from <code>Unfiled</code> and placed them in <code>Filed/{directory}</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-about-the-rest\">What About The Rest?</h3>\n<p>There are many documents that aren't easily processed this way though. My next inspiration came in the shower (of course). If you squint enough, or are far enough away, all documents from the same entity of the same type look the same. So all my mortgage statements look the same, but the numbers are different.</p>\n<p>I installed ImageMagick, and wrote a script to make a low-resolution thumbnail of each PDF. I made the resolution low enough that the text isn't readable even if you magnify the image.</p>\n<p>Then I searched for ways to compare images and came across <a href=\"https://github.com/rivo/duplo\">duplo</a>, which appears to do what I need. It does a hash of the image and allows you to compare other documents to that hash to find a similarity score. Using this type of process my next goal is to group similar documents together by searching for ones with matching or close-to-matching image hashes.</p>\n<p>But that'll be probably next weekend.

That was a rabbit hole of searching, let me tell ya true.</p>\n<p>Since the <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-subsystem-for-linux-graduates-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update/\">Fall Creator's Update</a> WSL has had more than one distribution available to install. You can install SUSE, Ubuntu, and soon Fedora. So deep down in my soul, I KNOW that I can have multiple copies of Ubuntu running with separate filesystems. That would reproduce the LXD environments I created in Linux.</p>\n<p>After some research, it turns out that the WSL management API is available in the Windows SDK, and several projects already take advantage of this fact. First I found <a href=\"https://github.com/yuk7/WSL-DistroLauncher\">this one</a> which allows you to do a lot of work and install any Linux distro you want. I knew I was on the right track. My next big find was <a href=\"https://github.com/DDoSolitary/LxRunOffline\">LxRunOffline</a> which was built to allow you to install WSL without being online. It also has the secondary ability to let you install any number of WSL instances. Now we're cooking with gas!</p>\n<p>I downloaded <code>LxRunOffline</code> and read the <a href=\"https://github.com/DDoSolitary/LxRunOffline/wiki/Ubuntu\">wiki</a>, which has links to the Ubuntu root filesystem that is installed during a regular WSL install. Following their instructions, I downloaded the rootfs, put it next to the <code>LxRunOffline</code> binary, and installed <em>another</em> copy of Ubuntu as a new WSL instance.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">LxRunOffline 2.1.1\nCopyright (C) 2017 DDoSolitary\n\nERROR(S):\n  No verb selected.\n\n  list                List all installed distributions.\n\n  default             Get or set the default distribution, which is used by bash.exe.\n\n  install             Install a new distribution.\n\n  register            Register an existing installation directory.\n\n  uninstall           Uninstall a distribution\n\n  unregister          Unregister a distribution but not delete the directory containing it.\n\n  move                Move a distribution to a new directory.\n\n  run                 Run a command in a distribution.\n\n  dir                 Get the installation directory of a distribution.\n\n  config-env          Get or set the default environment variables of a distribution.

I use <a href=\"https://github.com/mintty/wsltty\">wsltty</a> sometimes as my terminal emulator, and it comes with convenient batch files to launch WSL as a user, as root, and other scenarios. I copied one of those batch files and modified it to point to one of my new Ubuntu instances like this:</p>\n<h3 id=\"original\">Original</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">%LOCALAPPDATA%\\wsltty\\bin\\mintty.exe -i &quot;%PROGRAMFILES%/WindowsApps/CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_1604.2017.922.0_x64__79rhkp1fndgsc/images/icon.ico&quot; --WSL= -h err --configdir=&quot;%APPDATA%\\wsltty&quot;  -~\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"modified\">Modified</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">%LOCALAPPDATA%\\wsltty\\bin\\mintty.exe -i &quot;%PROGRAMFILES%/WindowsApps/CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_1604.2017.922.0_x64__79rhkp1fndgsc/images/icon.ico&quot; --WSL=&quot;Gophercon&quot; -h err --configdir=&quot;%APPDATA%\\wsltty&quot;  -~\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the modified batch file, the <code>--WSL=&quot;Gophercon&quot;</code> references a registered WSL distribution called <code>Gophercon</code> which I created with <code>LxRunOffline</code>. I repeated this process for each of the new instances, and changed the icons for them so I can launch them easily from the start menu.</p>\n<p>Now I have multiple installations of WSL/Ubuntu that are isolated from each other. Exactly what I wanted. The development workflow is nearly identical to the Linux/LXD version, I open a terminal and start coding.</p>\n<p>The end result is that each WSL Ubuntu installation has a separate filesystem, so each project is isolated. Using <a href=\"https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/\">yadm</a> I can clone my <a href=\"https://github.com/bketelsen/dotfiles\">dotfiles</a> and run the included <code>bootstrap</code> script which updates the system and installs all the packages I need for development with a single command. That's quick and easy.</p>\n<p>Windows looks better and better for Linux development. And the webcam always works...</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","comment_id":"6288cf7dc868ac020bd6852c","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/startmenu.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-05-21T07:39:41.000-04:00","updated_at":"2022-05-21T07:40:39.000-04:00","published_at":"2017-12-13T00:00:00.000-05:00","custom_excerpt":"Use WSL to create isolated development environments.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"62889299a640e2020be86e4c","name":"Windows","slug":"windows","description":"Windows","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/VS-CODE-GOPHER.png","visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":"#4a47a3","url":"https://brian.dev/tag/windows/"}],"authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Brian Ketelsen","slug":"brian","profile_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/logo-copy-1.png","cover_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/time-machine-1.jpg","bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":"@bketelsen","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/author/brian/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"Brian Ketelsen","slug":"brian","profile_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/logo-copy-1.png","cover_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/time-machine-1.jpg","bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":"@bketelsen","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/author/brian/"},"primary_tag":{"id":"62889299a640e2020be86e4c","name":"Windows","slug":"windows","description":"Windows","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/VS-CODE-GOPHER.png","visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":"#4a47a3","url":"https://brian.dev/tag/windows/"},"url":"https://brian.dev/getting-crazy-with-windows-subsystem-for-linux/","excerpt":"Use WSL to create isolated development environments.","reading_time":3,"access":true,"send_email_when_published":true,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null,"frontmatter":null},{"id":"62890cf6c868ac020bd6858b","uuid":"6516751c-ece8-4958-b36a-03e3a11ccf1c","title":"Learn With Me: Moving Gophercon to Azure","slug":"learn-with-me-moving-gophercon-to-azure","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I've recently taken on a new role at Microsoft as a Cloud Developer Advocate for Open Source projects on Azure.

Here's why:</p>\n<p>I've been whining about Apple and the way they've ignored the power users for quite some time now. I've been using Linux for development for several years, and always wanted a way to run Linux as my primary OS. But the sad truth (for me) is that there are just some things that prevent me from using Linux as my full time operating system. Email might be the biggest, but there are other apps that are missing or just sub-par.</p>\n<p>MacOS was always &quot;close-enough&quot; to Linux that most things worked well. Docker made things a little more difficult initially, then a little better with the new Docker for Mac. But it still wasn't Linux, and it's hard to argue that developing on the platform you ship to is the right choice. The OS itself is still visually superior to anything else, but it's been showing the signs of neglect for a few years now. It's clear from Apple's recent announcements that they are a mobile OS/hardware company that happens to sell computers too. They're not sad to lose me, I'm sure.</p>\n<p>My article in July about <a href=\"https://brian.dev/i3-windows/\">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> hinted at my excitement about being able to run a solid desktop OS but still do the open source sort of development that really needs to be done on a Linux type operating system. I abandoned that effort in July because it was still too alpha quality. Too many things didn't work. But it's November now, several builds later and Microsoft is shipping Ubuntu 16.04.1 in the latest Windows Insider releases.</p>\n<p>I took the plunge and bought a Surface Pro 4 when Microsoft announced the trade in program (still good until the 10th of November I think...) to give up to $650 off of a Surface device. This Surface is just the right size for an airplane tray, has an i7 and 16GB of RAM, and most importantly the Linux subsystem just works for the most part. I haven't done anything yet that failed. I'm sure there are still things that won't work, but for my primary use -- writing Go applications, teaching Kubernetes and Go, hacking on open source projects -- it all works.</p>\n<p>I was even able to run i3 Window manager again. No flaws, no errors. Windows has solid email and calendar applications, and let's face it; Chrome is Chrome on every OS, and we spend more time there than any other app besides the terminal. SPEAKING OF THE TERMINAL, Microsoft has done some serious house cleaning there. The terminal is fast, has true color support, transparency, auto layout correction on resizing, who knows what else has been fixed under the covers? It's 80% of what you'd expect from gnome-terminal. And that's a far cry from the old CMD.exe days.</p>\n<p>I don't expect to be running X Windows often, when I'm deep in a hacking session I'll probably open up i3 window manager, it's still the most productive way to code. Neovim and vim-go work perfectly in Windows bash, so it's not a stretch to think I could just have a couple of bash windows open and alt-tab between them. SSH and SCP work perfectly, and I can still cross-compile Go binaries for any platform (like my Raspberry Pi for my bbq app!).</p>\n<p>The most amazing part of all of this is that I simply git cloned my <a href=\"https://github.com/bketelsen/dotfiles\">dotfiles</a> from my Ubuntu installs and ran them un-altered. It's the same experience, but without the hardware headaches that Linux always brings, nor the lack of good quality applications.</p>\n<p>I think Apple has lost its hunger, and Microsoft found it.  The tables have turned from the funny switching campaigns with Justin Long looking hip and making fun of the frumpy John Hodgman.  Today's Microsoft is a completely different animal.  They're contributing heavily to open source projects, they've opened up the .Net platform, they're embracing developers and open source enthusiasts openly while Apple counts dollar bills from iPhone sales in a vault in Switzerland somewhere.</p>\n<p>I got a lot of amused responses on Twitter when I announced my switch. This environment may not yet be perfect, but my bet is on Microsoft for the future. I'm surprised to be saying that, but the evidence is clear that Apple isn't the company it was under Steve Jobs. And Microsoft isn't the company it was under Balmer.

The 1.7 release is especially nice, so I'm going to mention some of my favorite changes in this release.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ibm-z-system-support\">IBM z System Support</h3>\n<p>Bill O'Farrell gave a <a href=\"https://github.com/gophercon/2016-talks/blob/master/BillO'Farrell-GoForLinuxOnZ.pptx\">talk</a> at GopherCon 2016 about this port and I found it fascinating. Supporting Go on big iron can only be good for the language and for Go users everywhere. This is an exciting development and I'm looking forward to see what comes next from the IBM team.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ssa-in-the-compiler\">SSA In the Compiler</h3>\n<p>The compiler got an upgrade in Go 1.7 -- with Static Single Assignment, or SSA support. This new SSA support means that it will be easier in the future to analyze and optimize your code while it's being compiled. Coupled with other changes in the compiler toolchain, we've already seen some nice improvements both in compile times and binary size decreases. Kudos to the Go team for putting in the hard work and planning for future optimizations. SSA is going to bring us big things.</p>\n<h3 id=\"context-is-now-in-standard-library\">Context is now in standard library</h3>\n<p>Perhaps my favorite new feature: the x/net/context package has been moved into the standard library. Additionally, packages like net/http and os/exec have gained support for this new package without breaking the Go 1 compatibility contract. The Context package allows you to support cancelation, timeouts, and stores interesting request-specific data -- allowing you to have more control over the network requests that you make.</p>\n<h3 id=\"macos-sierra\">macOS Sierra</h3>\n<p>A big caveat with this release: If you compile binaries for macOS Sierra you'll need to use either Go 1.6.3 or Go 1.7. Binaries compiled with older versions of Go won't work reliably on macOS Sierra. They may appear to be working, but I've seen firsthand that they'll eventually fail in spectacular ways. If you distribute binaries using an automated build system, please update your automation to use Go 1.6.3 or Go 1.7.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> Go 1.6.3 was re-broken with the new macOS Sierra beta 4. Use 1.7.</p>\n<h3 id=\"performance\">Performance</h3>\n<p>Changes to the garbage collector and other runtime components should result in a &quot;5-35%&quot; improvement in the speed of your application. I absolutely love that Go gets better and faster with each release. Compile times are coming back down after the big spike in the 1.5 release.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hooray\">Hooray</h3>\n<p>Check out all of the changes over on the Go <a href=\"https://golang.org/doc/go1.7\">blog</a>.

Here's a quick refresher:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>This spring Microsoft announced <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about\">Bash on Ubuntu on Windows</a>, also known as the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Read the post, the FAQ, etc in that link. I'll summarize: Microsoft wants to make Windows the best place for ALL developers to work. A lofty and ambitious goal, to say the least. Their crazy idea -- translate Linux system calls into NT Kernel calls using a small shim layer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This is not a virtual machine. The system calls are translated by the shim layer (WSL) and run directly on the NT Kernel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This is kind of a Big Deal. If it works, it has the potential to win back many developers who abandoned the Windows platform years ago because of the inability of Windows to deal with the *nix world. The huge popularity of Ruby, Python, Redis, and dozens of other *nix first tools that were born in *nix. Some of these tools, like Ruby, have Windows installers, but Windows is an afterthought and second-class citizen at best.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Many developers (like me) started using Windows but moved to Mac or Linux operating systems over the years as it became increasingly hard to write software in Windows.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[Opinion] Linux isn't the best place to work 100% of the time. Office applications are lacking compatibility and features. There is no decent email client for Linux. Save your apologist comments and <em>what about Open Office/Geary/Thunderbird</em> comments. If you've used them, you know that they're not as nice as the applications available in macOS and Windows.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[Opinion] macOS is slipping in quality, and falling behind in features. I've grown increasingly frustrated over the past 3 years using MacOS X as my daily driver. Frequent crashes and very poor QA from Apple have lead to an operating system that used to be amazing becoming less so at each release. I used to be a dyed in the wool Mac zealot. Apple eroded my confidence in their operating system to the point that macOS is now where I go to do emails and other administrative tasks, but I do daily development on an Arch linux desktop sitting next to my MacBook Pro. Worse, although macOS is UNIX compliant and has an almost-*nix like environment available, far too many things don't work in macOS that are required for modern Internet software development. The hacks that we've put up with over the years are a testament to how poor Linux is for administrative work and how nice macOS was for the same.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given this set of circumstances and opinions, I was more than a little excited when Microsoft announced WSL. It promised to give developers what could be the best of all worlds. A modern and capable desktop operating system -- Windows 10 -- with all of the quality features and support for modern hardware that we would expect. AND a real installation of Ubuntu Linux running along side of it. Not virtualized, running in Virtual Box or Parallels Desktop or VMWare, but right there on my laptop running at native speed. The idea has real promise.</p>\n<p>So when I got a new Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition (Ubuntu Pre-installed) the first thing I did was put the latest version of Windows 10 Insider Edition on it. Over the course of a day it updated to Build 14379, which is the latest as of July 2, 2016. I had tried previous builds, but found simple things like git or zsh didn't work well.</p>\n<p>Imagine my surprise when I installed Bash for Windows on this build and pretty much everything worked. I cloned my <a href=\"https://github.com/bketelsen/dotfiles\">dotfiles</a> and ran the post-install scripts that install i3 window manager, neovim, zsh, Go, and all the requisite development tools that I'm used to. Nothing failed. (I didn't try running i3 yet, because I knew there was no X server installed)</p>\n<p><em>Nothing Failed</em></p>\n<p>The real shortfall of running Bash for Windows right now is the lack of a good terminal emulator. I tried ConEmu and maybe half a dozen others, with ConEmu being the best of this sorry lot. If you're used to using a good terminal in Linux, none of the tools available on Windows are going to satisfy you.</p>\n<p>I knew from my Windows work 20 years ago that there were XWindows servers available. I searched and found MobaXterm. It has a built in terminal emulator (also crap -- sorry), but among the other features included there's a pretty good X Windows server.</p>\n<p>I've been in love with i3 window manager since Erik St. Martin introduced me to it 3 years ago. Having such nicely organized and tiled windows over multiple desktops is an amazing productivity boon. With good keyboard shortcuts for every operation, I found I never took my hands off the keyboard.</p>\n<p>I started MobaXTerm and looked at the X Server settings. I shrugged, fired up the X Server and typed &quot;i3&quot; in my bash prompt. <code>i3</code> complained that there was another window manager already running. I went back to the X Server settings and chose &quot;Windowed Mode: X11 Server constrained to a single window&quot;. It was the only X Server that didn't also start a window manager like <code>dwm</code> or <code>fvwm</code>. So it started a simple &quot;rooted&quot; X Server which appears as a window on my Windows desktop with a black screen.</p>\n<p>Returning to bash, I typed <code>i3</code> again. Gloriously, the famililar <code>i3</code> session appeared. I'm able to install and run Linux GUI applications like Firefox. I have <code>terminator</code> running as my terminal emulator. I'm running <code>zsh</code> as my shell. Neovim <em>just works</em>, as does Go. All of them think they're running on a Linux computer, because for all intents and purposes they are. It just happens to have a Windows NT kernel at its core.</p>\n<p>Strange, strange times we live in. 20 years ago Microsoft called Linux a cancer and did everything they could to make it die. Today they're embracing Linux -- and by extension me -- and I have to say I'm really impressed with the outcome.</p>\n<p><em>This article was created in <code>neovim</code> for Linux, running on a <code>zsh</code> shell inside <code>i3 window manager</code> running in a MobaXTerm X Server on a Windows 10 laptop.</em></p>\n<p>Screen shots:</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/windows-on-top-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://brian.dev/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/windows-on-top-1.png 600w, https://brian.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/windows-on-top-1.png 1000w, https://brian.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2022/05/windows-on-top-1.png 1600w, https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/windows-on-top-1.png 1920w\"><figcaption>i3 behind Slack and File Explorer</figcaption></figure>","comment_id":"62890dd2c868ac020bd6859b","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/i3.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2022-05-21T12:05:38.000-04:00","updated_at":"2022-05-21T12:09:57.000-04:00","published_at":"2016-07-03T00:00:00.000-04:00","custom_excerpt":"That might be the longest title for a blog post ever, but it's kind of hard to describe what's going on here if you're not familiar with the latest updates from Microsoft land.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"62889299a640e2020be86e4c","name":"Windows","slug":"windows","description":"Windows","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/VS-CODE-GOPHER.png","visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":"#4a47a3","url":"https://brian.dev/tag/windows/"},{"id":"62889299a640e2020be86e4a","name":"Linux","slug":"linux","description":"Linux","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/Bit_Linux.png","visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":"#012293","url":"https://brian.dev/tag/linux/"}],"authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Brian Ketelsen","slug":"brian","profile_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/logo-copy-1.png","cover_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/time-machine-1.jpg","bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":"@bketelsen","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/author/brian/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"Brian Ketelsen","slug":"brian","profile_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/logo-copy-1.png","cover_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/time-machine-1.jpg","bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":"@bketelsen","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/author/brian/"},"primary_tag":{"id":"62889299a640e2020be86e4c","name":"Windows","slug":"windows","description":"Windows","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/VS-CODE-GOPHER.png","visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":"#4a47a3","url":"https://brian.dev/tag/windows/"},"url":"https://brian.dev/i3-windows/","excerpt":"That might be the longest title for a blog post ever, but it's kind of hard to describe what's going on here if you're not familiar with the latest updates from Microsoft land.","reading_time":4,"access":true,"send_email_when_published":false,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null,"frontmatter":null},{"id":"62890febc868ac020bd68638","uuid":"d51bfb0f-c3e8-46b5-a2a7-7e8ec29ce8cc","title":"Old Dogs","slug":"old-dogs","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>For 15 or more years I have told myself that I can't do frontend web work.

Many other people have mentioned it, so I won't belabor the point -- the Javascript ecosystem is huge and confusing.

I have had the most success with React, and accomplished the most here. I really love mixing inline markup with code. That's nice and feels comfortable. Seems like there are too many ways to put together a React project and it felt like the heaviest of all of the things I tried. Still probably my favorite, though.</li>\n<li>Polymer - The Polymer project appeals to me because of the nice UI components, but I had a harder time here due to the lack of documentation and sample projects that I can learn from. I still had moderate success, but it wasn't as easy to understand as React was, especially around how to tie things together using events.</li>\n<li>Vue.js - Vue.js looks nice, but I disliked the strange decoration syntax, which reminds me a bit of Angular. I tried a little &quot;hello world&quot; app and abandoned it due to my distaste for the syntax and concepts.</li>\n<li>Mithril - This one looks really promising, and felt the &quot;lightest&quot; of all of the frameworks I tried. I really disliked the process of assembling the views with javascript functions rather than inline markup (React style). That feels so clunky. Maybe there is a way to use templates, I didn't investigate enough.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, I did make quite a bit of progress on the Javascript side of the equation. I'll keep experimenting and learning. I know I said I wouldn't belabor the point, but do we really need NPM, Webpack, Grunt, Gulp, Bower and all the rest of this mess just to build a web app? I am really unsure of what each of them is supposed to do and where they fit -- which are complementary and which aren't. Seems strange to have a project with bower dependencies and npm dependencies vendored in two different folders. And I never did figure out by looking at the configuration files how the app knows where to find those vendored libraries. Too much magic.</p>\n<p>As I get more comfortable, I think I'd like to try doing some things with just jQuery or backbone.js - something much lighter and farther down the framework stack to see how it feels. Would love recommendations if you have any.</p>\n<p>It hasn't been as hard as I thought it would be. It hasn't really been <em>fun</em> either, though. I suspect with time I'll be more comfortable and I continue to press myself to learn. Thanks for following along.</p>\n<p>Post Script:<br>\nI've done each of these test projects using either Javascript or TypeScript, but where possible I also did a version using <a href=\"http://www.gopherjs.org\">GopherJS</a> which I found to be really fun. I have decided not to do my learning using GopherJS because it is an additional layer of translation that is causing me more mental load than it should. I really love that project though, and when I'm feeling stronger in the JS world, I'll move back to GopherJS because it still feels like home. The people in the GopherJS community have been awesome - Luna Duclos, Dominik Honnef, Dmitri Shuralyov, and Bjorn Erik Pedersen have had a tremendous amount of patience with me. Many thanks!</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","comment_id":"62890f6dc868ac020bd685f1","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/cubicroot-xyz-rFNVqR2rJE0-unsplash.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2022-05-21T12:12:29.000-04:00","updated_at":"2022-05-21T12:14:18.000-04:00","published_at":"2016-05-04T00:00:00.000-04:00","custom_excerpt":"Notes as I learn modern front-end development","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"62890fccc868ac020bd68632","name":"Web","slug":"web","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/tag/web/"}],"authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Brian Ketelsen","slug":"brian","profile_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/logo-copy-1.png","cover_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/time-machine-1.jpg","bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":"@bketelsen","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/author/brian/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"Brian Ketelsen","slug":"brian","profile_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/logo-copy-1.png","cover_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/time-machine-1.jpg","bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":"@bketelsen","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/author/brian/"},"primary_tag":{"id":"62890fccc868ac020bd68632","name":"Web","slug":"web","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/tag/web/"},"url":"https://brian.dev/new-tricks/","excerpt":"Notes as I learn modern front-end development","reading_time":3,"access":true,"send_email_when_published":false,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null,"frontmatter":null},{"id":"62891101c868ac020bd6869e","uuid":"8aad8f56-44c3-4b4e-bbe3-3d094c906778","title":"Tasty Worms","slug":"tasty-worms","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>A coworker sent me a link to this recipe and I have to share it.
