I made my own Egg Bites this morning, inspired by the delicious ones I like to get at Starbucks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"recipe\">Recipe</h3>\n<p>Prep:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Preheat your oven to 325 Fahrenheit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eggs</li>\n<li>Cheese</li>\n<li>Bacon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also Need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Muffin Pan</li>\n<li>Vegetable Spray</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Directions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I started by cutting a vertical slice off a new rasher of bacon so I had a dozen 2 inch pieces of bacon. I fried up the bacon until it was pretty crispy, then drained it and blotted it to get as much of the grease off of it as possible.</li>\n<li>Then, I sprayed a muffin pan made for pretty decent sized muffins with vegetable spray to prevent sticking.</li>\n<li>Next, I coated the bottom of the muffin pan with shredded cheddar cheese.</li>\n<li>I placed a few pieces of bacon on top of the shredded cheese.</li>\n<li>Next I whipped eggs in a bowl, then poured them over the cheese/bacon in the muffin pans. I filled the muffin pan roughly 2/3 full. That was about 2 eggs per muffin slot. This will vary based on your muffin pan size.</li>\n<li>Finally, I sprinkled more cheese on top.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I baked them for 12 minutes initially, they weren't done. So I added another 6, then another 2 minutes. It ended up being perfect at 20 minutes. Your mileage will vary based on your oven, and the size of muffin pan.</p>\n<p>Next I'll vary the ingredients. Keep in mind they'll get soggy if you add wet ingredients (I'm specifically thinking of things like red and green peppers which hold a lot of water). Lots of different combinations sound yummy, and they seem to be keeping well in the refridgerator.</p>\n<p>Delicious!</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","comment_id":"6288cf28c868ac020bd6851a","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/eggbites.jpeg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-05-21T07:38:16.000-04:00","updated_at":"2022-05-21T07:39:23.000-04:00","published_at":"2019-09-13T00:00:00.000-04:00","custom_excerpt":"This post is a change from the usual technical content.
