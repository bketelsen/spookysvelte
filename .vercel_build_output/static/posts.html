The system relies on a single function in my \u003Ccode>bashrc\u003C/code> and a directory full of bash scripts. Let's dive in and see how it works.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"installation-scripts\">Installation Scripts\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>In my dotfiles directory, which is stored at \u003Ccode>~/dotfiles\u003C/code> there's a subdirectory called \u003Ccode>install\u003C/code>. That directory contains a few dozen bash scripts that install the various software components and packages I might use. Some of them are needed on all the computers I use, some of them are used only infrequently for certain projects. Here's an example that installs Go:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"language-bash\">❯ go.sh\n#! /bin/bash\nset -e\nVERSION=1.15\n# Delete existing Go installation\nsudo rm -rf /usr/local/go\n# Install Go in /usr/local\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/local/go &amp;&amp; curl -Ls https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go$VERSION.linux-amd64.tar.gz | sudo tar xvzf - -C /usr/local/go --strip-components=1\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>The script declares a \u003Ccode>VERSION\u003C/code> variable so I can change the version to be installed when there's a new release of Go. Then it deletes the existing Go installation and replaces it with a freshly downloaded version. Because it deletes the existing install and replaces it, it can be run more than once with no unwanted side-effects. I've attempted to make all my scripts idempotent like this, but some of them just aren't because my bash skills are just mediocre.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"installation-function\">Installation Function\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>To use these installation scripts I've created a bash function that searches for scripts in the \u003Ccode>~/dotfiles/install\u003C/code> folder matching the first argument of the function:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"language-bash\">inst() {\n\tif [ -f $HOME/dotfiles/install/$1.sh ] ; then\n\t\techo Installing $1\n\t\t. $HOME/dotfiles/install/$1.sh\n\telse\n\t\techo $1 not found\n\tfi\n}\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>To install Go using this function I would type \u003Ccode>$&gt; inst go\u003C/code>, which would search for a script called \u003Ccode>~/dotfiles/install/go.sh\u003C/code> and execute it if it exists. It's not complicated, and only took a few minutes to write the function, but I'm getting a lot of ROI on the time I spend writing installation scripts. When I spin up a new VM somewhere, I can quickly clone my dotfiles and install just the bits I need for a particular task.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"direnv-integration\">Direnv integration\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>I've been playing with \u003Ccode>direnv\u003C/code> integrations to make the installation of required tools or commands automatic when entering a project directory.

It'd be really convenient to be able to get at documents from a Filesystem interface by using different facets like keywords, dates, categories, etc. That might fit more cleanly with the way I think, too.

Nearly everything I have is in pdf format, but there are a few TIFF files in there too. This program is in flux right now, so I'm not going to release it as Open Source until it's settled a bit.

So I decided to use a hash of the file contents as a key. \u003Ccode>SHA256\u003C/code> seems to be the right algorithm for file contents, low cost computation, low collision chance.

The writeup on the Gopheracademy blog describes a fun way to create an isolated container-based environment for each project by using LXD on Ubuntu.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Last night I wondered to myself if there was a way to get a similar experience by manipulating \u003Ca href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq\">Windows Subsystem for Linux\u003C/a> somehow. That was a rabbit hole of searching, let me tell ya true.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Since the \u003Ca href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-subsystem-for-linux-graduates-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update/\">Fall Creator's Update\u003C/a> WSL has had more than one distribution available to install. You can install SUSE, Ubuntu, and soon Fedora. So deep down in my soul, I KNOW that I can have multiple copies of Ubuntu running with separate filesystems. That would reproduce the LXD environments I created in Linux.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After some research, it turns out that the WSL management API is available in the Windows SDK, and several projects already take advantage of this fact. First I found \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/yuk7/WSL-DistroLauncher\">this one\u003C/a> which allows you to do a lot of work and install any Linux distro you want. I knew I was on the right track. My next big find was \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/DDoSolitary/LxRunOffline\">LxRunOffline\u003C/a> which was built to allow you to install WSL without being online.

Here's why:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I've been whining about Apple and the way they've ignored the power users for quite some time now. I've been using Linux for development for several years, and always wanted a way to run Linux as my primary OS. But the sad truth (for me) is that there are just some things that prevent me from using Linux as my full time operating system. Email might be the biggest, but there are other apps that are missing or just sub-par.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>MacOS was always &quot;close-enough&quot; to Linux that most things worked well. Docker made things a little more difficult initially, then a little better with the new Docker for Mac. But it still wasn't Linux, and it's hard to argue that developing on the platform you ship to is the right choice. The OS itself is still visually superior to anything else, but it's been showing the signs of neglect for a few years now. It's clear from Apple's recent announcements that they are a mobile OS/hardware company that happens to sell computers too. They're not sad to lose me, I'm sure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My article in July about \u003Ca href=\"https://brian.dev/i3-windows/\">Windows Subsystem for Linux\u003C/a> hinted at my excitement about being able to run a solid desktop OS but still do the open source sort of development that really needs to be done on a Linux type operating system. I abandoned that effort in July because it was still too alpha quality. Too many things didn't work. But it's November now, several builds later and Microsoft is shipping Ubuntu 16.04.1 in the latest Windows Insider releases.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I took the plunge and bought a Surface Pro 4 when Microsoft announced the trade in program (still good until the 10th of November I think...) to give up to $650 off of a Surface device. This Surface is just the right size for an airplane tray, has an i7 and 16GB of RAM, and most importantly the Linux subsystem just works for the most part. I haven't done anything yet that failed. I'm sure there are still things that won't work, but for my primary use -- writing Go applications, teaching Kubernetes and Go, hacking on open source projects -- it all works.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I was even able to run i3 Window manager again. No flaws, no errors. Windows has solid email and calendar applications, and let's face it; Chrome is Chrome on every OS, and we spend more time there than any other app besides the terminal. SPEAKING OF THE TERMINAL, Microsoft has done some serious house cleaning there. The terminal is fast, has true color support, transparency, auto layout correction on resizing, who knows what else has been fixed under the covers? It's 80% of what you'd expect from gnome-terminal. And that's a far cry from the old CMD.exe days.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't expect to be running X Windows often, when I'm deep in a hacking session I'll probably open up i3 window manager, it's still the most productive way to code. Neovim and vim-go work perfectly in Windows bash, so it's not a stretch to think I could just have a couple of bash windows open and alt-tab between them. SSH and SCP work perfectly, and I can still cross-compile Go binaries for any platform (like my Raspberry Pi for my bbq app!).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The most amazing part of all of this is that I simply git cloned my \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/bketelsen/dotfiles\">dotfiles\u003C/a> from my Ubuntu installs and ran them un-altered. It's the same experience, but without the hardware headaches that Linux always brings, nor the lack of good quality applications.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think Apple has lost its hunger, and Microsoft found it.  The tables have turned from the funny switching campaigns with Justin Long looking hip and making fun of the frumpy John Hodgman.  Today's Microsoft is a completely different animal.  They're contributing heavily to open source projects, they've opened up the .Net platform, they're embracing developers and open source enthusiasts openly while Apple counts dollar bills from iPhone sales in a vault in Switzerland somewhere.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I got a lot of amused responses on Twitter when I announced my switch.

Supporting Go on big iron can only be good for the language and for Go users everywhere. This is an exciting development and I'm looking forward to see what comes next from the IBM team.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"ssa-in-the-compiler\">SSA In the Compiler\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The compiler got an upgrade in Go 1.7 -- with Static Single Assignment, or SSA support. This new SSA support means that it will be easier in the future to analyze and optimize your code while it's being compiled. Coupled with other changes in the compiler toolchain, we've already seen some nice improvements both in compile times and binary size decreases. Kudos to the Go team for putting in the hard work and planning for future optimizations. SSA is going to bring us big things.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"context-is-now-in-standard-library\">Context is now in standard library\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Perhaps my favorite new feature: the x/net/context package has been moved into the standard library. Additionally, packages like net/http and os/exec have gained support for this new package without breaking the Go 1 compatibility contract. The Context package allows you to support cancelation, timeouts, and stores interesting request-specific data -- allowing you to have more control over the network requests that you make.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"macos-sierra\">macOS Sierra\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>A big caveat with this release: If you compile binaries for macOS Sierra you'll need to use either Go 1.6.3 or Go 1.7. Binaries compiled with older versions of Go won't work reliably on macOS Sierra. They may appear to be working, but I've seen firsthand that they'll eventually fail in spectacular ways. If you distribute binaries using an automated build system, please update your automation to use Go 1.6.3 or Go 1.7.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>UPDATE\u003C/strong> Go 1.6.3 was re-broken with the new macOS Sierra beta 4.

Here's a quick refresher:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>This spring Microsoft announced \u003Ca href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about\">Bash on Ubuntu on Windows\u003C/a>, also known as the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Read the post, the FAQ, etc in that link. I'll summarize: Microsoft wants to make Windows the best place for ALL developers to work. A lofty and ambitious goal, to say the least. Their crazy idea -- translate Linux system calls into NT Kernel calls using a small shim layer.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>This is not a virtual machine. The system calls are translated by the shim layer (WSL) and run directly on the NT Kernel.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>This is kind of a Big Deal. If it works, it has the potential to win back many developers who abandoned the Windows platform years ago because of the inability of Windows to deal with the *nix world. The huge popularity of Ruby, Python, Redis, and dozens of other *nix first tools that were born in *nix. Some of these tools, like Ruby, have Windows installers, but Windows is an afterthought and second-class citizen at best.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Many developers (like me) started using Windows but moved to Mac or Linux operating systems over the years as it became increasingly hard to write software in Windows.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>[Opinion] Linux isn't the best place to work 100% of the time. Office applications are lacking compatibility and features. There is no decent email client for Linux. Save your apologist comments and \u003Cem>what about Open Office/Geary/Thunderbird\u003C/em> comments. If you've used them, you know that they're not as nice as the applications available in macOS and Windows.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>[Opinion] macOS is slipping in quality, and falling behind in features. I've grown increasingly frustrated over the past 3 years using MacOS X as my daily driver. Frequent crashes and very poor QA from Apple have lead to an operating system that used to be amazing becoming less so at each release. I used to be a dyed in the wool Mac zealot. Apple eroded my confidence in their operating system to the point that macOS is now where I go to do emails and other administrative tasks, but I do daily development on an Arch linux desktop sitting next to my MacBook Pro. Worse, although macOS is UNIX compliant and has an almost-*nix like environment available, far too many things don't work in macOS that are required for modern Internet software development. The hacks that we've put up with over the years are a testament to how poor Linux is for administrative work and how nice macOS was for the same.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Given this set of circumstances and opinions, I was more than a little excited when Microsoft announced WSL. It promised to give developers what could be the best of all worlds. A modern and capable desktop operating system -- Windows 10 -- with all of the quality features and support for modern hardware that we would expect. AND a real installation of Ubuntu Linux running along side of it. Not virtualized, running in Virtual Box or Parallels Desktop or VMWare, but right there on my laptop running at native speed. The idea has real promise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So when I got a new Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition (Ubuntu Pre-installed) the first thing I did was put the latest version of Windows 10 Insider Edition on it. Over the course of a day it updated to Build 14379, which is the latest as of July 2, 2016. I had tried previous builds, but found simple things like git or zsh didn't work well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Imagine my surprise when I installed Bash for Windows on this build and pretty much everything worked. I cloned my \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/bketelsen/dotfiles\">dotfiles\u003C/a> and ran the post-install scripts that install i3 window manager, neovim, zsh, Go, and all the requisite development tools that I'm used to. Nothing failed. (I didn't try running i3 yet, because I knew there was no X server installed)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Nothing Failed\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The real shortfall of running Bash for Windows right now is the lack of a good terminal emulator. I tried ConEmu and maybe half a dozen others, with ConEmu being the best of this sorry lot. If you're used to using a good terminal in Linux, none of the tools available on Windows are going to satisfy you.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I knew from my Windows work 20 years ago that there were XWindows servers available. I searched and found MobaXterm. It has a built in terminal emulator (also crap -- sorry), but among the other features included there's a pretty good X Windows server.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I've been in love with i3 window manager since Erik St. Martin introduced me to it 3 years ago. Having such nicely organized and tiled windows over multiple desktops is an amazing productivity boon. With good keyboard shortcuts for every operation, I found I never took my hands off the keyboard.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I started MobaXTerm and looked at the X Server settings. I shrugged, fired up the X Server and typed &quot;i3&quot; in my bash prompt. \u003Ccode>i3\u003C/code> complained that there was another window manager already running. I went back to the X Server settings and chose &quot;Windowed Mode: X11 Server constrained to a single window&quot;. It was the only X Server that didn't also start a window manager like \u003Ccode>dwm\u003C/code> or \u003Ccode>fvwm\u003C/code>. So it started a simple &quot;rooted&quot; X Server which appears as a window on my Windows desktop with a black screen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Returning to bash, I typed \u003Ccode>i3\u003C/code> again. Gloriously, the famililar \u003Ccode>i3\u003C/code> session appeared. I'm able to install and run Linux GUI applications like Firefox. I have \u003Ccode>terminator\u003C/code> running as my terminal emulator. I'm running \u003Ccode>zsh\u003C/code> as my shell. Neovim \u003Cem>just works\u003C/em>, as does Go. All of them think they're running on a Linux computer, because for all intents and purposes they are. It just happens to have a Windows NT kernel at its core.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Strange, strange times we live in. 20 years ago Microsoft called Linux a cancer and did everything they could to make it die. Today they're embracing Linux -- and by extension me -- and I have to say I'm really impressed with the outcome.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>This article was created in \u003Ccode>neovim\u003C/code> for Linux, running on a \u003Ccode>zsh\u003C/code> shell inside \u003Ccode>i3 window manager\u003C/code> running in a MobaXTerm X Server on a Windows 10 laptop.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Screen shots:\u003C/p>\n\u003C!--kg-card-end: markdown-->\u003Cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full kg-card-hascaption\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/windows-on-top-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://brian.dev/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/windows-on-top-1.png 600w, https://brian.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/windows-on-top-1.png 1000w, https://brian.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2022/05/windows-on-top-1.png 1600w, https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/windows-on-top-1.png 1920w\">\u003Cfigcaption>i3 behind Slack and File Explorer\u003C/figcaption>\u003C/figure>","comment_id":"62890dd2c868ac020bd6859b","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/i3.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2022-05-21T12:05:38.000-04:00","updated_at":"2022-05-21T12:09:57.000-04:00","published_at":"2016-07-03T00:00:00.000-04:00","custom_excerpt":"That might be the longest title for a blog post ever, but it's kind of hard to describe what's going on here if you're not familiar with the latest updates from Microsoft land.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"62889299a640e2020be86e4c","name":"Windows","slug":"windows","description":"Windows","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/VS-CODE-GOPHER.png","visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":"#4a47a3","url":"https://brian.dev/tag/windows/"},{"id":"62889299a640e2020be86e4a","name":"Linux","slug":"linux","description":"Linux","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/Bit_Linux.png","visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":"#012293","url":"https://brian.dev/tag/linux/"}],"authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Brian Ketelsen","slug":"brian","profile_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/logo-copy-1.png","cover_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/time-machine-1.jpg","bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":"@bketelsen","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/author/brian/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"Brian Ketelsen","slug":"brian","profile_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/logo-copy-1.png","cover_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/time-machine-1.jpg","bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":"@bketelsen","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/author/brian/"},"primary_tag":{"id":"62889299a640e2020be86e4c","name":"Windows","slug":"windows","description":"Windows","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/VS-CODE-GOPHER.png","visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":"#4a47a3","url":"https://brian.dev/tag/windows/"},"url":"https://brian.dev/i3-windows/","excerpt":"That might be the longest title for a blog post ever, but it's kind of hard to describe what's going on here if you're not familiar with the latest updates from Microsoft land.","reading_time":4,"access":true,"send_email_when_published":false,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null,"frontmatter":null},{"id":"62890febc868ac020bd68638","uuid":"d51bfb0f-c3e8-46b5-a2a7-7e8ec29ce8cc","title":"Old Dogs","slug":"old-dogs","html":"\u003C!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->\u003Cp>For 15 or more years I have told myself that I can't do frontend web work.

This isn't a book-length treatise on the subject, but I do have a few notes about my progress.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's been a little overwhelming going from zero to having an idea about what I'm doing. Many other people have mentioned it, so I won't belabor the point -- the Javascript ecosystem is huge and confusing. Seriously.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>I played with several different frameworks with varying results. I'm not sure whether my success and/or appreciation of the frameworks is based on my bias and previous learnings, but some are much easier than others to pick up.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>React - I really like React as a concept -- at least what I \u003Cem>understand\u003C/em> of the concept of React. I have had the most success with React, and accomplished the most here. I really love mixing inline markup with code. That's nice and feels comfortable. Seems like there are too many ways to put together a React project and it felt like the heaviest of all of the things I tried. Still probably my favorite, though.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Polymer - The Polymer project appeals to me because of the nice UI components, but I had a harder time here due to the lack of documentation and sample projects that I can learn from. I still had moderate success, but it wasn't as easy to understand as React was, especially around how to tie things together using events.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Vue.js - Vue.js looks nice, but I disliked the strange decoration syntax, which reminds me a bit of Angular. I tried a little &quot;hello world&quot; app and abandoned it due to my distaste for the syntax and concepts.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Mithril - This one looks really promising, and felt the &quot;lightest&quot; of all of the frameworks I tried. I really disliked the process of assembling the views with javascript functions rather than inline markup (React style). That feels so clunky. Maybe there is a way to use templates, I didn't investigate enough.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Overall, I did make quite a bit of progress on the Javascript side of the equation. I'll keep experimenting and learning. I know I said I wouldn't belabor the point, but do we really need NPM, Webpack, Grunt, Gulp, Bower and all the rest of this mess just to build a web app? I am really unsure of what each of them is supposed to do and where they fit -- which are complementary and which aren't. Seems strange to have a project with bower dependencies and npm dependencies vendored in two different folders. And I never did figure out by looking at the configuration files how the app knows where to find those vendored libraries. Too much magic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As I get more comfortable, I think I'd like to try doing some things with just jQuery or backbone.js - something much lighter and farther down the framework stack to see how it feels. Would love recommendations if you have any.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It hasn't been as hard as I thought it would be. It hasn't really been \u003Cem>fun\u003C/em> either, though. I suspect with time I'll be more comfortable and I continue to press myself to learn. Thanks for following along.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Post Script:\u003Cbr>\nI've done each of these test projects using either Javascript or TypeScript, but where possible I also did a version using \u003Ca href=\"http://www.gopherjs.org\">GopherJS\u003C/a> which I found to be really fun. I have decided not to do my learning using GopherJS because it is an additional layer of translation that is causing me more mental load than it should. I really love that project though, and when I'm feeling stronger in the JS world, I'll move back to GopherJS because it still feels like home. The people in the GopherJS community have been awesome - Luna Duclos, Dominik Honnef, Dmitri Shuralyov, and Bjorn Erik Pedersen have had a tremendous amount of patience with me. Many thanks!\u003C/p>\n\u003C!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","comment_id":"62890f6dc868ac020bd685f1","feature_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/cubicroot-xyz-rFNVqR2rJE0-unsplash.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2022-05-21T12:12:29.000-04:00","updated_at":"2022-05-21T12:14:18.000-04:00","published_at":"2016-05-04T00:00:00.000-04:00","custom_excerpt":"Notes as I learn modern front-end development","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"62890fccc868ac020bd68632","name":"Web","slug":"web","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/tag/web/"}],"authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Brian Ketelsen","slug":"brian","profile_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/logo-copy-1.png","cover_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/time-machine-1.jpg","bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":"@bketelsen","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/author/brian/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"Brian Ketelsen","slug":"brian","profile_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/logo-copy-1.png","cover_image":"https://brian.dev/content/images/2022/05/time-machine-1.jpg","bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":"@bketelsen","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/author/brian/"},"primary_tag":{"id":"62890fccc868ac020bd68632","name":"Web","slug":"web","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://brian.dev/tag/web/"},"url":"https://brian.dev/new-tricks/","excerpt":"Notes as I learn modern front-end development","reading_time":3,"access":true,"send_email_when_published":false,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"email_subject":null,"frontmatter":null},{"id":"62891101c868ac020bd6869e","uuid":"8aad8f56-44c3-4b4e-bbe3-3d094c906778","title":"Tasty Worms","slug":"tasty-worms","html":"\u003C!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->\u003Cp>A coworker sent me a link to this recipe and I have to share it.
